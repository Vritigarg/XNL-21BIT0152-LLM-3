## LLM-Powered Fraud Detection & Anomaly Analysis
### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
## This project leverages LLM embeddings and transformer models to analyze transaction descriptions, detect anomalies, and flag potential fraudulent activities.The system integrates with a vector database to enable rapid anomaly identification through similarity search.
###  ðŸ“ŒPart 1: DATA PREPARATION AND FEATURE ENGINEERING
### 1.1 Simulate a Transaction Dataset
##### Generated synthetic transaction data with metadata (e.g., transaction descriptions, amount, timestamp, merchant category, etc.).
##### Preprocessing Steps:
##### Text cleaning (removing special characters, lowercasing)
##### Tokenization for LLM input
##### Handling missing values and outliers
### 1.2 Generate Embeddings
#### A pretrained transformer model, here I have used "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
##### Steps:
##### Convert transaction descriptions into vector embeddings.
##### Batch process and store embeddings in a database for efficient retrieval.

###  ðŸ“ŒPART 2: INTEGRATION WITH A VECTOR DATABASE
### 2.1 Set Up a Vector Database, here I have used FAISS
##### Steps:
##### Configure vector database and upload embeddings.
##### Index the data for optimized similarity search.
### 2.2 Implement Similarity Search for Anomaly Detection
##### Query mechanism retrieves similar transactions based on embeddings.
##### Defined similarity thresholds to differentiate between normal and anomalous clusters., like in this case I have defined threshold value as 1.05 to maintain a balance
##### In this Project I have used FAISS for similarity Search plus I have manually also used keyword Search (like words like "unauthorized","hacked") are also detected as fraud
##### Flag transactions that deviate significantly from known pattern

###  ðŸ“ŒPART 3: DEVELOP THE FRAUD DETECTION PIPELINE
### 3.1 Build a Processing Pipeline
#### Workflow:
#### Ingest new transactions
#### Compute embeddings
#### Perform similarity search
#### Flag anomalies
#### Implement robust error handling to ensure reliability.
### 3.2 Implement Alert Generation
#### Generated an Email System where if the Transaction is detected Anamolous, the person is alerted via Email, this is only done for the sole purpose of Testing

This is the alert system That I Made that if any transaction is detected fraud it will send an email to that person

###  ðŸ“ŒPART 4: TESTING & PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
### 4.1 Develop a Comprehensive Test Suite
#### Unit and integration tests to simulate normal and fraudulent transactions.
### 4.2 Conduct Comparative Analysis
#### Compare detection performance of LLM-based approach vs. rule-based/statistical methods.
